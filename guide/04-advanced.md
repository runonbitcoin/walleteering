# Chapter 4. Advanced Considerations

TODO

- OP_RETURN data - learned purse how to check.
- Only work on mainnet?
- Handling Backed Jigs properly
    await purseTests(run, { supportsBackedJigs: true })
- Broadcast
- Exported transactions
- Handling custom locks (ie. signing, owner)
- Performance and parallel

## Where to go from here?

* Announce your wallet in the `run` channel on [Atlantis](https://atlantis.planaria.network/)
* Reach out to apps for integration
* Publish the source code on GitHub
* Prepare your wallet for a wave of new apps
